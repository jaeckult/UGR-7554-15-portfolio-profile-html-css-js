        <p class="essay-1">
          The idea of a now page came from Derek Sivers. A page I stumbled on while trying to see which webrings were still active. These aren't exactly goals, but a collection of experiences I would like to complete.
        </p>
        <p class="essay-1">
          I am fine delaying and rolling over to the next quarter if I don't have enough time to complete it. Either I am well enough to continue working on the tasks, too busy trying to keep myself afloat or dead with the tasks being no longer my problem.

        <p class="essay-paragraph-1">
          The focus of this season is introspection, a backlog that I've neglected and previous goals which were not completed. Recently, I've been made aware of some negative traits of mine. With cursory thoughts, I see it affects my relationship with myself. Working on this will have a positive effect on my relationship with everyone else.

        <p class="essay-paragraph-1">
          This spring is a busy time. I am trying to re-orient myself to handle the rest of the year. The quarter started strong, then was blown off track by the stings of boredom and burnout.

          At the time, I was exploring individuallism vs caring for myself as a member of a community. This might re-appear as a goal-point after I read Frantz Fanon's Wretched of the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is also when I had some awakenings about everyday life and lost most of my heroes. It ended with my giving up religion. I have oscillated between being a Christian revert & apostate for many years. The bombing of Bethlehem on Christmas Day with little out-cry from Western Church leaders was the final straw for me. It does not make sense for me to practice a religion that is so far removed from its roots / holy sites. This was not the first time I noticed that what is generally practiced is an abstract version of Christianity, but it was the occasion that disgusted me the most. The other Abrahamic religions do not appeal to me.
